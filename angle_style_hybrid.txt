angle_style hybrid command :h3

[Syntax:]

angle_style hybrid style1 style2 ... :pre

style1,style2 = list of one or more angle styles :ul

[Examples:]

angle_style hybrid harmonic cosine
angle_coeff 1 harmonic 80.0 1.2
angle_coeff 2* cosine 50.0  :pre

[Description:]

The {hybrid} style enables the use of multiple angle styles in one
simulation.  An angle style is assigned to each angle type.  For
example, angles in a polymer flow (of angle type 1) could be computed
with a {harmonic} potential and angles in the wall boundary (of angle
type 2) could be computed with a {cosine} potential.  The assignment
of angle type to style is made via the "angle_coeff"_angle_coeff.html
command or in the data file.

In the angle_coeff command, the first coefficient sets the angle style
and the remaining coefficients are those appropriate to that style.
In the example above, the 2 angle_coeff commands would set angles of
angle type 1 to be computed with a {harmonic} potential with
coefficients 80.0, 1.2 for K, r0.  All other angle types (2-N) would
be computed with a {cosine} potential with coefficient 50.0 for K.

[Restrictions:]

Angle styles can only be set for atom styles that allow angles to be
defined.

This angle style is part of the "molecular" package.  It is only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_2 section for more info.
