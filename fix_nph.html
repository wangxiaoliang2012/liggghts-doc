<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Perform constant NPH integration to update positions and velocities
each timestep for atoms in the group using a Nose/Hoover pressure
barostat.  P is pressure.  This creates a system trajectory consistent
with the isobaric ensemble.  Unlike <A HREF = "fix_npt.html">fix npt</A>,
temperature will not be controlled if no other fix is used.
Temperature can be controlled independently by using "<A HREF = "fix_langevin.html">fix
langevin</A> or <A HREF = "fix_temp_rescale.html">fix
temp/rescale</A>.
</P>
<P>The atoms in the fix group are the only ones whose velocities and
positions are updated by the velocity/position update portion of the
NPT integration.
</P>
<P>Regardless of what atoms are in the fix group, a global pressure is
computed for all atoms.  Similarly, when the size of the simulation
box is changed, all atoms are re-scaled to new positions, unless the
keyword <I>dilate</I> is specified with a value of <I>partial</I>, in which case
only the atoms in the fix group are re-scaled.  The latter can be
useful for leaving the coordinates of atoms in a solid substrate
unchanged and controlling the pressure of a surrounding fluid.
</P>
<P>This fix computes a temperature each timestep, to contribute to the
pressure.  The fix creates its own method for computing T, as if it
had been defined by the command:
</P>
<PRE>temperature fix-ID all full 
</PRE>
<P>See the <A HREF = "temperature.html">temperature</A> command for details.  Note that
this is NOT the temperature with ID = <I>default</I>.  This means you can
change the attributes of this fix's temperature (e.g. its
degrees-of-freedom) via the <A HREF = "temp_modify.html">temp_modify</A> command or
print the temperature with thermodyanmic output via the <A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style
custom</A> command using the appropriate temp-ID =
fix-ID.  It also means that changing attributes of the default
temperature will have no effect on this fix.  Alternatively, you can
directly assign a new temperature to the fix via the
<A HREF = "fix_modify.html">fix_modify</A> command.  If you do this, note that the
kinetic energy derived from T should be consistent with the virial
term computed using all atoms.  LAMMPS will warn you if you choose to
compute temperature on a subset of atoms.
</P>
<P>The pressure can be controlled in one of several styles, as specified
by the <I>p-style</I> argument.  In each case, the desired pressure at each
timestep is a ramped value during the run from the starting value to
the end value.  The <A HREF = "run.html">run</A> command documents how to make the
ramping take place across multiple runs.
</P>
<P>Style <I>xyz</I> means couple all 3 dimensions together when pressure is
computed (isotropic pressure), and dilate/contract the 3 dimensions
together.
</P>
<P>Styles <I>xy</I> or <I>yz</I> or <I>xz</I> means that the 2 specified dimensions are
coupled together, both for pressure computation and for
dilation/contraction.  The 3rd dimension dilates/contracts
independently, using its pressure component as the driving force.
</P>
<P>For style <I>aniso</I>, all 3 dimensions dilate/contract independently
using their individual pressure components as the 3 driving forces.
</P>
<P>For any of the styles except <I>xyz</I>, any of the independent pressure
components (e.g. z in <I>xy</I>, or any dimension in <I>aniso</I>) can have
their target pressures (both start and stop values) specified as NULL.
This means that no pressure control is applied to that dimension so
that the box dimension remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>In some cases (e.g. for solids) the pressure (volume) and/or
temperature of the system can oscillate undesirably when a Nose/Hoover
barostat is applied.  The optional <I>drag</I> keyword will damp these
oscillations, although it alters the Nose/Hoover equations.  A value
of 0.0 (no drag) leaves the Nose/Hoover formalism unchanged.  A
non-zero value adds a drag term; the larger the value specified, the
greater the damping effect.  Performing a short run and monitoring the
pressure is the best way to determine if the drag term is working.
Typically a value between 0.2 to 2.0 is sufficient to damp
oscillations after a few periods.
</P>
<P>For all pressure styles, the simulation box stays rectangular in
shape.  Parinello-Rahman boundary conditions (tilted box) are not
implemented in LAMMPS.
</P>
<P>For all styles, the <I>Pdamp</I> parameter is specified in time units and
determines how rapidly the pressure is relaxed.  For example, a value
of 1000.0 means to relax the temperature in a timespan of (roughly)
1000 time units (tau or fmsec or psec - see the <A HREF = "units.html">units</A>
command).
</P>
<P>This fix supports the "fix_modify" options for <I>thermo</I> and <I>energy</I>.
The former will print the contribution the fix makes to the energy of
the system when thermodynamics is printed.  The latter will add this
contribution to the total potential energy (PotEng) so that energy
conservation can be monitored.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Any dimension being adjusted by this fix must be periodic.  A
dimension whose target pressures are specified as NULL can be
non-periodic or periodic.
</P>
<P>You should not use <A HREF = "fix_nvt.html">fix nvt</A> with this fix.  Instead, use
<A HREF = "fix_npt.html">fix npt</A> if you want to control both temperature and
pressure via Nose/Hoover.
