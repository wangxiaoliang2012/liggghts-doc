thermo_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

thermo_modify keyword value ... :pre

one or more keyword/value pairs may be listed :ulb,l
keyword = {temp} or {lost} or {norm} or {flush} or {line} or {format} :l
  {temp} value = ID of temperature
  {lost} value = {error} or {warn} or {ignore}
  {norm} value = {yes} or {no}
  {flush} value = {yes} or {no}
  {line} value = {one} or {multi}
  {format} value = {int} string or {float} string or N string
    N = integer from 1 to # of quantities being printed
    string = C-style format string
  {window} value = N
    N = number of previous print-outs to average over :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

thermo_modify temp mydef
thermo_modify lost no flush yes
thermo_modify line multi format float %g format 3 %15.8g :pre

[Description:]

Set options for how thermodynamics are computed and printed by LAMMPS.

The {temp} option allows you to specify how temperature is computed
when used to output thermodynamic info (temperature, kinetic energy,
pressure).  Different methods of computing temperature can be defined
via the "temperature"_temperature.html command.

The {lost} option determines whether LAMMPS checks for lost atoms each
time it computes thermodynamics and what it does if atoms are lost.
If the value is {ignore}, LAMMPS does not check for lost atoms.  If
the value is {error} or {warn}, LAMMPS checks and either issues an
error or warning.  The code will exit with an error and continue with
a warning.  This can be a useful debugging option.

The {norm} option determines whether the thermodynamic print-out is
normalized by the number of atoms or is the total summed across all
atoms.  Different unit styles have different defaults for this
setting.

The {flush} option invokes a flush operation after thermodynamic info
is written to the log file.  This insures the output in that file is
current (no buffering by the OS), even if LAMMPS halts before the
simulation completes.

The {line} option determines whether thermodynamics will be printed as
a series of numeric values on one line or in a multi-line format with
3 quantities with text strings per line and a dashed-line header
containing the timestep and CPU time.  This modify option overrides
the {one} and {multi} thermo_style settings.

The {format} option sets the numeric format of individual printed
quantities.  The {int} and {float} settings set the format for all
integer or floating-point quantities printed.  The setting with a
numeric value (e.g. format 5 %10.4g) sets the format of the Nth value
printed.  If the format for a specific value has been set, it will
take precedent over the {int} or {float} setting.

The {window} option sets the number of previous thermodynamic screen
outputs over which "thermo_style custom"_thermo_style.html {ave}
quantities are averaged when printed.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:]

"thermo"_thermo.html, "thermo_style"_thermo_style.html,
"temperature"_temperature.html

[Default:]

The option defaults are temp = default, lost = error, norm = yes for
unit style of {lj}, norm = no for unit style of {real} and {metal},
flush = no, window = 10.  The defaults for the line and format options
depend on the thermo style.  For styles "one", "granular", and
"custom" the line and format defaults are "one", "%8d", and "%12.8g".
For style "multi", the line and format defaults are "multi", "%8d",
and "%14.4f".
