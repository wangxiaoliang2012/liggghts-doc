fix drag command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID group-ID drag x y z fmag delta :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "fix"_fix.html command
drag = style name of this fix command
x,y,z = coord to drag atoms towards
fmag = magnitude of force to apply to each atom (force units)
delta = cutoff distance inside of which force \
        is not applied (distance units) :ul

[Examples:]

fix center small-molecule drag 0.0 10.0 0.0 5.0 2.0 :pre

[Description:]

Apply a force to each atom in a group to drag it towards the point
(x,y,z).  The magnitude of the force is specified by fmag.  If an atom
is closer than a distance delta to the point, then the force is not
applied.

Any of the x,y,z values can be specified as NULL which means do not
include that dimension in the distance calculation or force
application.

This command can be used to steer one or more atoms to a new location
in the simulation.

[Restrictions:] none
