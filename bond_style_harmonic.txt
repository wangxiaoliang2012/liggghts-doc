bond_style harmonic command :h3

[Syntax:]

bond_style harmonic :pre

[Examples:]

bond_style harmonic
bond_coeff 5 80.0 1.2 :pre

[Description:]

The {harmonic} bond style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/bond_harmonic.jpg)

where r0 is the equilibrium bond distance.  Note that the usual 1/2
factor is included in K.

The following coefficients must be defined for each bond type via the
"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K (energy/distance^2)
r0 (distance) :ul

[Restrictions:]

Bond styles can only be set for atom styles that allow bonds to be
defined.

This bond style is part of the "molecular" package.  It is only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_2 section for more info.

"bond_coeff"_bond_coeff.html, "delete_bonds"_delete_bonds.html

[Default:] none
