:line

print command :h3

[Syntax:]

print args :pre

args = one or more text strings and variables names to print out :ul

[Examples:]

print The system volume is now $v :pre

[Description:]

Print the list of arguments as a line of text to the screen and/or
logfile.  If variables are included in the arguments, they will be
evaluated and their values printed.  Note that if variables are
included, the print string should not be enclosed in double quotes,
else it will prevent the variables from being evaluated.

By using the print command in a section of the input script that is
looped over (see the "jump"_jump.html command), and by including
variables of the {equal} style (see the "variable"_variable.html
command), a string with changing values can be printed.

[Restrictions:] none
