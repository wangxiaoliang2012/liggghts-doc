atom_modify command :h3

[Syntax:]

atom_modify keyword value ... :pre

one or more keyword/value pairs may be appended :ulb,l
keyword = {map} :l
  {map} value = {array} or {hash} :pre
:ule

[Examples:]

atom_modify map hash :pre

[Description:]

Modify properties of the atom style selected within LAMMPS.

The {map} keyword determines how atom ID lookup is done for molecular
problems.  Lookups are performed by bond (angle, etc) routines in
LAMMPS to find the local atom index associated with a global atom ID.
When the {array} value is used, each processor stores a lookup table
of length N, where N is the total # of atoms in the system.  This is
the fastest method for most simulations, but a processor can run out
of memory to store the table for very large simulations.  The {hash}
value uses a hash table to perform the lookups.  This method can be
slightly slower than the {array} method, but its memory cost is
proportional to N/P on each processor, where P is the total number of
processors running the simulation.

[Restrictions:]

This command must be used before the simulation box is defined by a
"read_data"_read_data.html or "create_box"_create_box.html command.

[Related commands:] none

[Default:]

By default, atomic (non-molecular) problems do not allocate maps.
For molecular problems, the option default is map = array.
