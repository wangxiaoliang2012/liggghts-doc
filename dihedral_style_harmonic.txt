dihedral_style harmonic command :h3

[Syntax:]

dihedral_style harmonic :pre

[Examples:]

dihedral_style harmonic
dihedral_coeff 1 80.0 1 2 :pre

[Description:]

The {harmonic} dihedral style uses the potential

:c,image(Eqs/dihedral_harmonic.jpg)

The following coefficients must be defined for each dihedral type via the
"dihedral_coeff"_dihedral_coeff.html command as in the example above, or in
the data file or restart files read by the "read_data"_read_data.html
or "read_restart"_read_restart.html commands:

K (energy)
d (+1 or -1)
n (integer >= 0) :ul

[Restrictions:]

Dihedral styles can only be set for atom styles that allow dihedrals to be
defined.

This dihedral style is part of the "molecular" package.  It is only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the "Making
LAMMPS"_Section_start.html#2_2 section for more info.
