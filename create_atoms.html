<H3>create_atoms command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>create_atoms type region-ID 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>type = atom type (1-N) of atoms to create on a lattice
<LI>region-ID = ID of region each atom will belong to (optional) 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>

<PRE>create_atoms 1 regsphere
create_atoms 3 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command creates atoms on a lattice as an alternative to reading
in their coordinates via a <A HREF = "read_data.html">read_data</A> or
<A HREF = "read_restart.html">read_restart</A> command.  A simulation box must
already exist, which is created with the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A>
command.
</P>
<P>Before using this command, a lattice must be defined using the
<A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> command.  If a region is not specified, the
create_atoms command fills the entire simulation box with atoms on the
lattice.  If a region is specified, then the geometric volume is
filled that is inside the simulation box and is also consistent with
the region volume.
</P>
<P>The <I>create_atoms</I> command can be used multiple times with different
lattice orientations to create grain boundaries.  Used in conjunction
with the <A HREF = "delete_atoms.html">delete_atoms</A> command, reasonably complex
geometries can be created.  The <I>create_atoms</I> command can also be
used to add atoms to a system previously read in from a data or
restart file.  In all these cases, care should be taken to insure that
new atoms do not overlap existing atoms inappropriately.
</P>
<P>Created atoms are assigned the specified atom type and a velocity of
0.0.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>An <A HREF = "atom_style.html">atom_style</A> and <A HREF = "lattice.html">lattice</A> must be
previously defined to use this command.
