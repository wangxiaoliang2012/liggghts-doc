<H3>angle_style hybrid command

<P><B>Syntax:</B>

<PRE>angle_style hybrid style1 style2 ... 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>style1,style2 = list of one or more angle styles

<PRE>angle_style hybrid harmonic cosine
angle_coeff 1 harmonic 80.0 1.2
angle_coeff 2* cosine 50.0  
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The <I>hybrid</I> style enables the use of multiple angle styles in one
simulation.  An angle style is assigned to each angle type.  For
example, angles in a polymer flow (of angle type 1) could be computed
with a <I>harmonic</I> potential and angles in the wall boundary (of angle
type 2) could be computed with a <I>cosine</I> potential.  The assignment
of angle type to style is made via the <A HREF = "angle_coeff.html">angle_coeff</A>
command or in the data file.
</P>
<P>In the angle_coeff command, the first coefficient sets the angle style
and the remaining coefficients are those appropriate to that style.
In the example above, the 2 angle_coeff commands would set angles of
angle type 1 to be computed with a <I>harmonic</I> potential with
coefficients 80.0, 1.2 for K, r0.  All other angle types (2-N) would
be computed with a <I>cosine</I> potential with coefficient 50.0 for K.
</P>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Angle styles can only be set for atom styles that allow angles to be
defined.
</P>
<P>This angle style is part of the "molecular" package.  It is only
enabled if LAMMPS was built with that package.  See the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_2">Making
LAMMPS</A> section for more info.
