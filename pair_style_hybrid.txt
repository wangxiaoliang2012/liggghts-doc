pair_style hybrid command :h3

[Syntax:]

pair_style hybrid style1 style2 ... :pre

style1,style2 = list of one or more pair styles :ul

[Examples:]

pair_style hybrid lj/charmm/coul/long 10.0 eam
pair_coeff 1*2 1*2 eam niu3
pair_coeff 3 3 lj/cut/coul/cut 1.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1*2 3 lj/cut 0.5 1.2 :pre

[Description:]

The {hybrid} style enables the use of multiple pair styles in one
simulation.  A pair style can be assigned to each pair of atom types
via the "pair_coeff"_pair_coeff.html command.

For example, a metal on a LJ surface could be computed where the metal
atoms interact with each other via a {eam} potential, the surface
atoms interact with each other via a {lj/cut} potential, and the
metal/surface interaction is also via a {lj/cut} potential.

All pair styles that will be used must be listed in the pair_style
hybrid command (in any order).  The name of each sub-style is followed
by its arguments, as illustrated in the example above.

In the pair_coeff command, the first coefficient sets the pair style
and the remaining coefficients are those appropriate to that style.
For example, consider a simulation with 3 atom types: types 1 and 2
are Ni atoms, type 3 are LJ atoms with charges.  The following
commands would set up the hybrid simulation:

atom_style hybrid eam charge
pair_style hybrid eam lj/cut/coul/cut 10.0 lj/cut 8.0
pair_coeff 1*2 1*2 eam niu3
pair_coeff 3 3 lj/cut/coul/cut 1.0 1.0
pair_coeff 1*2 3 lj/cut 0.5 1.2 :pre

The "atom_style"_atom_style.html hybrid command is needed because
atoms in the simulation will have both EAM and charge attributes.

[Restrictions:] none

When using a long-range Coulomic solver (via the
"kspace_style"_kspace_style command) with pair_style hybrid, one or
more sub-styles will be of the "long" variety.
E.g. {lj/cut/coul/long} or {buck/coul/long}.  It is OK to have more
than one sub-style with a "long" component, but you must insure that
the short-range Coulombic cutoff used by each of these pair styles is
consistent.  Else the long-range Coulombic solve will be inconsistent.

The hybrid style cannot include any of the {granular} styles in its
list of styles to use.  Only one {coul/long} style can be used in the
list of hybrid styles.
